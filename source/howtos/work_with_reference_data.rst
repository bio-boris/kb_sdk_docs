Working with reference data
============================

Adding Reference Data to a KBase App
------------------------------------

.. topic:: Motivation

    Some tools and applications make use of large reference data
    collections. For example, a QC app may have a reference data with common
    contaminants. Adding data such as this to the git repo for the module
    can make it very large. In addition, the generated Docker image would
    also be very large. KBase App reference data is designed to address this
    scenario.

.. topic:: How Reference Data Works

    To minimize the image size, this feature works by saving reference data
    in a special volume space and then making that volume available through
    a read-only mount in /data at app execution time. An init mode for the
    module is run at registration time to initialize the reference data
    volume. In addition, the reference data is separately versioned, so
    code-only updates to a module can be made without having to
    re-initialize the reference data. Please name the data in a format 
    so that updates to the data will not overwrite the previous version of 
    the data. For example `RefData-V1.gz` for the first version and
    `RefData-V2.gz` for the next version. This will ensure that previous
    versions of the app can still access the older reference data.

Usage
-----

To make use of this feature, the app developer needs to do a few simple
things.

1. Add the data-version tag to the kbase.yaml file and give it a
   semantic version tag.
2. Add any downloading and data preparation steps to the init section of
   the entrypoint.sh script in the scripts directory. The init script
   should place the data in /data and any apps that use the data should
   be configured to look for the data in this location.
3. Create a \_\_READY\_\_ file in /data to indicate that the reference
   data volume was successfully created. Ideally, some sanity tests
   should be performed to confirm things ran correctly by testing for
   the presence of expected files. If the \_\_READY\_\_ file is not
   present, the registration will fail, and the reference data area will
   be removed.

You can see an example in the |RAST_link| 

Updating Reference Data
-----------------------

If a new version of reference data is required, the developer can
increase the version number for the reference data in kbase.yaml, make
any updates to the init section, and re-register the app. This will
trigger the registration to initialize the reference data for the new
data version. Older versions of the app will continue to use the
previous reference data specified in that versions kbase.yaml file. This
helps to ensure reproducibility.

Gotchas
-------

There a few things to watch out for with reference data:

-  The reference data area (/data) is mounted during initialization
   (module registration) and during app execution and replaces /data
   from the Docker image. Any modifications made by the Dockerfile to
   this space will not be visible. Changes must be done in the init
   block in entrypoint.sh.
-  The reference data is only writeable at registration time. This is to
   ensure that the data is not accidentally changed during execution
   which could break reproducibility. If the app requires the reference
   data to be writeable when it executes, then you add code to the
   execution that copies the data into the writeable work area prior to
   running the underlying application.
-  Reference data should be given a unique version identifier, so when
   adding new reference data, previous versions of the app will still
   have access to the reference data they need.
